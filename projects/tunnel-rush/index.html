    <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Once upon a time, in a digital realm far, far away (or just a few clicks, really), there
        was a brave little game called Tunnel Rush. It lived happily on a magical platform known as
        adfree3kh0.github.io, bringing joy and mild dizziness to players around the world.</p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-4">But alas! One fateful day, a terrifying creature known as the DMCA (Dastardly Monstrous
        Copyright Assassin) appeared! With a mighty roar and a flurry of legal jargon, it banished poor Tunnel Rush from
        the realm of Google Search.</p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-4">"But why?" cried the heartbroken players. "Why must our beloved Tunnel Rush suffer such a
        cruel fate?"</p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-4">The answer, dear friends, was as tragic as it was ridiculous. You see, Tunnel Rush had
        committed the gravest of sins in the digital world: it had allegedly worn someone else's copyright as a hat! Oh,
        the humanity!</p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-4">And so, our dear Tunnel Rush was cast out, forced to wander the dark corners of the
        internet, searching for a new home. Some say you can still hear its pixelated sobs echoing through the virtual
        valleys on quiet nights.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold">But fear not, brave gamers! For while Tunnel Rush may be gone, its spirit lives
        on in the hearts of players everywhere. And who knows? Perhaps one day, it will return, armed with proper
        licensing and a really good lawyer!</p>
